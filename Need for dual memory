Fpr R-type instruction (add/subtract only) we can use a single memory, while if we are designing load instruction microarchitecture we need separarte data and instruction memory
because seelector before single data/instruction memory needs a control logic(in fetch stage) which is available only after decode stage.

in multicycle execution due to presence of registers we donty need additional memory as we needed in single cycle.

In single cycle processor we need to access memory twice for some instructions so we need separate data memory and instruction memory
