This repository contains self learned RTL2GDS implementation of a RISC based microprocessor (simgle cycle, multi cycle, microprogrammed, pipelined).
We will start with sequential and stored program execution i.e. Von-Neuman architecture with mild flavour of data-flow architecture wherever needed for improvements
we will try to develop our processor by implementing each intruction as mentioned in https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2023/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=mips_reference_data.pdf
