This repository contains self learned RTL2GDS implementation of a RISC based microprocessor.
We will start with sequential and stored program execution i.e. Von-Neuman architecture with mild flavour of data-flow architecture wherever needed for improvements
we will try to develop our processor by implementing each intruction as mentioned in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25oZ7yMmgmw&list=PL1C2GgOjAF-JSlKHoSDOYVoF0lyCd76DD&index=2
